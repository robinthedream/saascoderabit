# Buggy Frontend Demo

This repository contains two intentionally buggy frontend pages:
1. A landing page with various CSS and JavaScript bugs
2. A SaaS dashboard with layout and functionality issues

These pages are created for demonstration and learning purposes to identify and fix common frontend bugs.

## Pages
- `index.html` - Landing page with 10 intentional bugs
- `dashboard.html` - SaaS dashboard with 14 intentional bugs

## Running Locally
Simply serve these files using any HTTP server. For example:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
